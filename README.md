Prerequisites
To run the password generator, you need to have Java installed on your computer. If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from the official website.

Installation

Usage
To generate a password, run the PasswordGenerator.java file in your favorite IDE or terminal. You will be prompted to enter the length of the password and to choose which character sets to include or exclude. Once you have provided the necessary input, the program will generate a strong, secure password.
